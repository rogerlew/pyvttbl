Ttest
==============================================
This class is capable of performing 1 sample, paired 
2 sample, and equal and unequal independent sample t-tests.

The observed power estimates have been validated against G*Power.

Example 1 sample t-test
-----------------------------

The `pop_mean` keyword specifies the population mean against which the data is tested.

::

    >>> df = DataFrame()
    >>> df.read_tbl('data/suppression~subjectXgroupXageXcycleXphase.csv')
    >>> D=df.ttest('SUPPRESSION', pop_mean=17.)
    >>> print(D)
